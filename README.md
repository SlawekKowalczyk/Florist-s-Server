# Florist-s-Server
The florist's is a client-server application. Here you will find the server description.
The shop is run on the server. The shop uses SQLite database. The customer connects the server where the shop is run. The shop downloads articles' names and prices from the server. The florist's customer chooses articles and gives his personal details. Then the shop sends the data to the server and generates the proof of purchase. If it is an individual customer it gets a receipt but if the bussines one - an invoice.

All articles of the shop are gathered in a database. While running the application the shop reads this data and enters it into the price list.
